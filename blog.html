                <p>Hardly-Disclosed Privacy Policies and Understanding Risk</p>

                <p>When considering the heavy reliance upon the Internet that we have developed as a society, it is easy to point out the benefits that come from it. Consider google.com, if one has a question, any sort of question, it is most likely that the first place they will go for the answer is google.com. We often do not consider the side-effects of doing so, but they are ever present and continue to get worse. The privacy of personal information is of concern to people when doing things like using an ATM, swiping a credit card at the grocery store, sending mail, and countless other tasks. Privacy is a concern, surely, to Internet users, but the risk associated with the sharing of information via the Internet is kept as discrete as possible by websites. </p>

                <p>Going back to the google.com example. The usual action of a user, is to pull up google.com on a web browser - or use google.com as a &quot;default search engine&quot; which is feature built into most modern web browsers. After having access to the searching function, the user types a search query and clicks the button to search. This service provided by Google, Inc. is simple, elegant, and widely used. </p>

                <p>Like most Applications&mdash;web or otherwise&mdash;google.com must have a &quot;Terms of Service,&rdquo; and if user information is collected, a &quot;Privacy Policy.&quot; The issue at hand is not whether the &quot;Terms of Service&quot; or the &quot;Privacy Policy&quot; are either unclear or deceiving in any way&mdash;they are quite clear and easier to read an understand than most others of their kind. The issue is the discreteness of said &quot;Terms&quot; and &quot;Policy.&quot;</p>

                <p>We consider the searching example again. When using google.com, little thought is considered about what information can be obtained about the user. Although users may not be considering this, it clearly states in the &quot;Privacy Policy&quot; that Google &ldquo;collect[s] information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content.&quot;</p>

                <p>An interesting perspective on &quot;Terms of Service,&quot; is to compare them to signing a waiver for a gym. Before ever using any of the equipment at a gym, it is required that the user sign a waiver that significantly limits the liability of the gym if the user were to get injured. This model of agreeing to the terms before use of the service or product, not only informs the user of the risk involved but, instills a sense of &quot;inherent risk&quot; when using any or all of the facilities at the gym. Even though the use of the equipment may not be inherently dangerous, the model of agreement before use, provides the user with a sense of risk. </p>

                <p>Contrasting the gym and google.com searches, it can be noted that they are quite opposite in the order of agreement to the terms&mdash;the gym being sign first, google.com being use first. The attitude of using google.com carries over into other software and services that Google provides. Some of the websites are based on the User Generated Content model (UGC), for example, youtube.com. Websites using UCG as their model, can be anything from youtube.com or instagram.com to facebook.com or twitter.com. Basically, if it is up to the users to add content, then it is a UGC website. </p>

                <p>In a recent study conducted by Jason M. Weimer, it was noted that users of UGC websites have &quot;low awareness and concern for the privacy risks.&quot; This becomes an issue when considering that &quot;Google collects and can integrate almost anything that&rsquo;s already in the Google ecosystem&quot; (Tsukayama). The sample of the study were students in a Media based studies department of a University. It is obvious that they would be prone to using UGC websites more frequently then whatever the average may be, but we would expect a heightened awareness of the risks associated to privacy, not the other way around. With Google&rsquo;s new &ldquo;Privacy Policy,&rdquo; mentioned by Tsakuyama, these risks are greater than ever. Google can now combine a user&rsquo;s searches, with the videos they like, and their provided personal information to create a cocktail of the user&rsquo;s information. This information can then be used in conjunction with Google&rsquo;s Ad service to generate revenue. All the while, the users, whom have agreed to the &ldquo;Terms of Service,&rdquo; are left trusting that this information does not get into the wrong hands.</p>

                <p>By not telling users up front that their information may be used in ways that they could be unaware of, websites let user fall into a trap. Compare this use-first-model of software to taking a taxi. When a user steps into a taxi, they do not have to sign a waiver or view a &quot;Terms of Service,&quot; because entering the taxi is them agreeing to these things. Why is this the case? There is an inherent risk when operating or riding in a motorized vehicle. By entering a search query at google.com, the user is doing the same thing as stepping into a taxi and it is assumed that they know the risk involved with using a common Internet-based service like google.com. </p>

                <p>It is important to define inherent and understand how it legally applies to these analogies. The Oxford English Dictionary defines &ldquo;inherent&rdquo; as &ldquo;existing in something as a permanent attribute or quality.&rdquo; When the term &ldquo;inherent risk&rdquo; is mentioned, it is meant to employ an idea that risk is an attribute associated with the activity. If one knows of a risk involved in an activity, they can make a conscious decision to avoid participating. The risks associated with privacy and the use of the Internet can be seen in no way &ldquo;inherent.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>The question of inherent risk is the main factor of this issue. Is it inherent that your privacy is at risk every time you are signed into a Google Account and use google.com or youtube.com? Base on the aforementioned study, the answer is no. It is not inherent. This can be blamed to on the ever apparent model of &quot;By using this software you...&quot; or worse, the model that Google uses: leaving the link to the &quot;Terms of Service&quot; and &quot;Privacy Policy&quot; at the bottom of the page, bating the user to first use the website, thus agree to the terms.</p>

                <p>The risk of information being shared or used in ways that may not be apparent to the user is ever present on the Internet. It is important to shift society's understanding of such risk from that of ignorance to ever-skeptical. Google as a company is just one example of the risks we take on a daily basis when using the internet, but the risk is evident in more places then we may assume. Knowing that the companies place the assumption of risk on the users and do not make it explicitly clear, may lead to us making this change in our own lives and the lives of others. Continue to use google.com, because it is one of the best search engines around, but read the &quot;Terms of Service&quot; and &quot;Privacy Policy&quot; and know that it does not come for free. </p>
